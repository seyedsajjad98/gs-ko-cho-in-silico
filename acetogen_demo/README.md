# Acetogen Design Demo (UT Tartu PhD application)

This folder collects a *very small* proof‑of‑concept for the project  
“Metabolic engineering of *Clostridium autoethanogenum* guided by cell‑free testing of genetic designs”  
(supervisors Kaspar Valgepea & Nilesh Kolhe).

## Demo Summary

- `acetogen_flux_demo.ipynb`:  
  Demonstrates flux balance analysis and gene knockout simulation using a placeholder COBRApy model.  
  Includes plots for growth rate and ethanol secretion.

- `models/MetaCLAU.spy`:  
  The original genome-scale model from Norman et al. (2019), currently in **ScrumPy format**.  
  Not yet compatible with COBRApy — conversion to SBML or JSON is planned after acceptance.

- `lit_review.md`:  
  Digest of 6 open-access cornerstone papers, annotated for this PhD project.

- `cell_free_schema.png`:  
  Visual diagram of the design-build-test-learn loop using cell-free TX-TL.

This repository is designed to show preparedness for the *Clostridium autoethanogenum* DBTL project at UT Tartu.
